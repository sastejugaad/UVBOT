# UVBOT
Autonomous Germ disinfectant robot. Robot uses Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation to kill germs. This technology is begin used around the world in the hospitals and airports for disinfecting people and equipment. Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation is a disinfection method that uses short-wavelength ultraviolet (ultraviolet C or UVC) light to kill or inactivate microorganisms by destroying nucleic acids and disrupting their DNA, leaving them unable to perform vital cellular functions. UVGI is used in a variety of applications, such as food, air, and water purification.

The robot uses an ultrasonic sensor to avoid obstacles autonomously. However, in the video robot is programmed to be fast to show the working but in the real file, there should be some delay so the uv light can kill germs effectively on one spot. You can do that by just increasing the delay in the program.
UV light shown in the example was marked by the seller as germicidal but there is no guarantee as I was not able to check it personally.

******Warning******
The purpose of this video was to show and inspire people about the use of robotics and engineering. This video is just a very early prototype please do not use it in real hospitals, houses or other places as a way for disinfectant. Be careful when buying and using uv light as if not used correctly may damage eyes or burn skin. Please use Germicidal UV light only and only buy from an authorized sellers.
